Dependencies
    OpenCV

    On ubuntu:
    sudo apt-get install libcv1 libcvaux libcvhighgui

building cgi binary:
    in the spritecutter-web/cgi-bin/spritecutter/ folder, run make

creating server:
    1. Configure the server - usually this involves creating a virtual host (apache config: extra/httpd-vhosts.conf)
        point the vhost document root to the spritecutter-web/htdocs/ folder

        ServerName spritecutterdev.com
        DocumentRoot "/var/http/spritecutter-web/htdocs"

    2. Add line to /etc/hosts file (usually necessary if using vhost):
        e.g. ####
        127.0.0.1   spritecutterdev.com 
    
    3. modify permissions to reflect current server config. Apache or lighttpd usually run under user "http".
        e.g. chmod -R 755 spritecutter-web/
    
    4. the spritecutter-web/htdocs/uploads/ directory needs to be read and written by the php and the server. Usually user "http"
        e.g. chown http spritecutter-web/htdocs/uploads/

After the server is started, the program should now be set up to cut mad sprites
