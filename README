Dependencies
    OpenCV

    On ubuntu:
    sudo apt-get install libcv1 libcvaux libcvhighgui

building cgi binary:
    In the spritecutter-web/cgi-bin/spritecutter/ folder, run make. 
    It should compile cleanly provided that the dependencies are intact.

testing cgi binary:
    cd spritecutter-web/cgi-bin/
    ./spritecutter <input image> -o <output directory> -p<filename prefix>

    If it runs correctly, you should see the specified directory with the cut sprite, 
    and xml vector file. 

creating server:
    1.  Configure the server - usually this involves creating a virtual host 

        Lighttpd config example:

        $HTTP["host"] == "spritecutterdev.com"  {
            server.document-root = "/var/www/spritecutter-web/htdocs/"
            server.server-root = "/var/www/spritecutter-web/"
        }

        Apache example:

        <VirtualHost *:80>
            ServerName kjb.homeunix.com
            DocumentRoot "/var/www/spritecutter-web/htdocs"
            RewriteEngine on
            <Directory "/">
                Options MultiViews -Indexes FollowSymLinks SymLinksIfOwnerMatch IncludesNoExec
            </Directory>
        </VirtualHost>

    2.  If testing locally, add line to /etc/hosts file (usually necessary if using vhost):
        e.g. ####
        127.0.0.1   spritecutterdev.com 
    
    3.  modify permissions to reflect current server config. Apache or lighttpd usually run under 
        user "http".
        e.g. chmod -R 755 spritecutter-web/
    
    4.  the spritecutter-web/htdocs/uploads/ directory needs to be read and written by the php and the 
        server. Usually user "http"
        e.g. chown http:http spritecutter-web/htdocs/uploads/

After the server is started, the program should now be set up to cut mad sprites
